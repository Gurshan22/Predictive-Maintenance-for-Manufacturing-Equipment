# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Manufacturing-Equipment
This project would develop models to predict equipment failures in manufacturing settings before they occur, similar to the robot safety project but applied to different machinery.

Key Components:

Time-series analysis of sensor data from equipment
Feature extraction from temporal patterns
Implementation of LSTM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models
Early warning system development with configurable alert thresholds
Cost-benefit analysis of predictive vs. reactive maintenance
Real-time deployment considerations
